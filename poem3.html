                I thought I was art

                My canvas smooth
                Unmarked in youth
                I took for granted its unblemished state
                First brushes soft
                As others scoffed
                Their visions they could not relate

                I thought I was art

                Knives that drew
                Dark lines that grew
                Like swirls of smoke or toxic vapor
                With each stroke
                Something broke
                And crimson splattered across the paper

                I thought I was art

                Countless colors
                Outshine others
                I tore myself into a sketch
                I thought that they
                Would finally say
                That I was more than just a wretch

                I thought I was art

                Streaks here to stay
                Still on display
                Red lines became my nirvana
                It’s so perverse
                Cannot reverse
                I guess I fancied myself a Madonna


                Am I art?

                I rejoice
                In my new choice
                Pain had clouded my artistic vision back then
                Heal my heart
                For I am art
                And I will never paint again
            </pre>

					<h1>Exploring Gambling Behavior in High School Students</h1>
					<h2> Project Overview</h2>
					<p>
						In this project, I examined how nature and nurture influence high school students’ likelihood to gamble. These findings could potentially have important policy implications, inform prevention programs, and help identify which student groups are linked to risky behaviors.
						The 2006 High School Risk Survey, the primary dataset used in this project, includes data from about 4,500 students across 10 Connecticut public high schools. It captures their attitudes toward risk and risky behaviors (drug usage, gambling frequency, alcohol consumption, etc.) and represents the broader population of U.S. public high school students in 2006. Stata and Excel were the primary tools used to analyze and visualize the data.

					<h2>
						Analysis
					</h2>
					<p>
						First, I created a dependent variable called <em>gambling_hours</em> that represents the number of hours a student spends per week on gambling-related activities. Feature selection was based on available variables in the dataset and factors I believed would have valuable interpretations. The linear regression models I created focused on predicting the number of hours adolescents spend gambling per week based on the given characteristics of the student. Model 2 looks specifically at environmental factors such as family income, gambling education, part-time job status, and exposure to adult gambling while controlling for drug use. The results show that teens from middle and high-income families tend to gamble less than those from lower-income families. Having a part-time job is also linked to reduced gambling hours. Exposure to adults talking about gambling is associated with increased gambling time. Drug use is associated with an increase in gambling hours and is included as a control to minimize omitted variable bias.

						The following table summarizes several OLS regression results and reveals which model features are statistically significant:

					<p>
						Additionally, I created logistic regression models to determine the percentage changes in the odds of a gambling-related event happening given a change in the dependent variables. Gambling-related events were defined as (a) having purchased a lottery ticket, (b) having used a slot machine, and (c) having placed an online bet. The models created are shown below:

                    <span class="image main"><img src="images/logitmodelresults.png" alt="logistic regression models" /></span>
					<p>
						The logit models revealed that family income’s effect on gambling behavior varies across models. In the first two models, the difference between high and low-income students is not statistically significant, with Model 2 showing a slight 2% increase in gambling odds for wealthier students, possibly due to greater disposable income. In Model 3, high family income becomes statistically significant, indicating its influence on specific gambling behaviors. Among nurture factors, being from a middle-income family significantly reduces the odds of gambling, while exposure to adults discussing gambling increases those odds. However, gender, representing a nature/biological factor, consistently has the strongest impact across all models with males being associated with a higher odds of gambling compared to females.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the next stage of advanced analysis, we employed a two-stage least squares regression along with a likelihood ratio test to better identify causal effects and address potential endogeneity concerns. The selected instrument variable (IV) was the presence or lack of family drug problems. It is theoretically correlated with student drug usage due to genetics, exposure, and access, thus satisfying the relevance condition necessary for an instrumental variable. We assume family drug problems do not directly cause gambling issues, meeting the exclusion restriction and establishing the IV as exogenous. The first-stage LR-test yielded an F statistic of 91.5, indicating that family drug usage is a very strong instrument. This IV estimates the local average treatment effect for students whose drug use is influenced by family drug problems. Our results suggested that, within this subgroup, students who use drugs gamble on average about 3.18 more hours per week than those who do not. Student drug usage was found to be statistically significant with a p-value of 0.001, confirming this effect at the 95% confidence level.

					<h2>
						Key Insights
					</h2>
					<p>
						This project's findings provide important conclusions and reflections for educators and policymakers aiming to reduce adolescent gambling behaviors and frequency. Our findings revealed how a single classroom session on gambling risks reduces adolescent gambling by about 12 minutes per week, demonstrating that brief, evidence-based lessons in health classes can indeed be effective at reducing risky behaviors. Adolescents who frequently overhear adults discussing gambling tend to gamble approximately 18 minutes more weekly, highlighting how environmental factors can unintentionally normalize gambling behaviors. There is also a strong link between substance use and gambling, with drug-using adolescents gambling about 1.6 hours more per week than their peers. Together, these results suggest that gambling prevention should be integrated into both school curricula and substance abuse programs to better support at-risk youth.

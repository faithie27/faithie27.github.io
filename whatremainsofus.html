            <pre>
There was a line I crossed that day
The day I left you at the bend
It hit me as I walked away
And saw the line drawn in the sand

Grass and stone and silver stream
Lines pattern out mosaic walls
Landscapes are not what they seem
Both villainous and prosaic falls

Across the sand we tripped the light
Borders scattered in many grains
From dawn of day to break of night
We rejoiced in absent chains

But beneath fluid crystal sea
Lay permanence etched in rock
And amid our crossing free
I stumbled o’er this cardinal lock

A shifting trembled throughout the earth
And sand was lost in fault and crack
My footprints defaced your self-worth
Nothing I did could bring it back

And even after the shaking’s quell
My heel-print remained carved in stone
The bond between us decayed and fell
We still danced but now alone

A bridge of gold was burned that day
A remnant monument of loss
And now I take care not to stray
Over the line I shouldn’t cross

          <h2>what remains of us</h2>
          <p>This poem was inspired by the idea of dancing being a metaphor for the crossing of personal boundaries.</p>
          <blockquote class="poem-snapshot">
        <pre>

            A shifting trembled throughout the earth
            And sand was lost in fault and crack
            My footprints defaced your self-worth
            Nothing I did could bring it back
                
            And even after the shaking’s quell
            My heel-print remained carved in stone
            The bond between us decayed and fell
            We still danced but now alone
            </pre>

          <p>a girl doesn't realize the beauty in what she has until it's too late</p>
          <blockquote class="poem-snapshot">
            <pre>

            “Apples are just boring” – I said
            sifting and sorting through the red
            sweet and crunchy for too long a time
            so I decided to add a squeeze of lime

            It brought a freshness to my lungs
            but citric acid stung my tongue
            I glanced at all the different brands
            of rainbow I had at my hands
            </pre>

          <h2>House Fire</h2>
          <p>This poem is about someone with severe anxiety</p>
          <blockquote class="poem-snapshot">
            <pre>

              I thought my house was on fire
              So I pulled on some clothes and slid out of bed
              And ran downstairs to see only darkness instead
              I checked all the stoves, the pans and the steel
              But all I saw were the orange flames that had just seemed so real
              
              I thought my house was on fire
              So I dropped all my files and raced to my car
              Examined each wire and door left ajar
              I wondered which of my senses had played this cruel joke
              For I was still choking on each tendril of smoke    
            </pre>

          <h2>the frost</h2>
          <p>Internal rhymes and structural changes show how the reader comes to a realization about a loss</p>
          <blockquote class="poem-snapshot">
            <pre>
              
            You crept in like the frost that signals the beginning of a long winter
            I looked at you with the same wonder that I save for the stars
            At first you were so delicate – so beautiful – in shards
            But your love made up for the cuts on my hands
            I remember I took such care to not shatter you
            But then you grew – and so quickly too
            and consumed the leaves, the trees
            the cold ground bruised my knees
            </pre>

        <h1>House Fire</h1>

          <pre>
            I thought my house was on fire
            So I pulled on some clothes and slid out of bed
            And ran downstairs to see only darkness instead
            I checked all the stoves, the pans and the steel
            But all I saw were the orange flames that had just seemed so real
            
            I thought my house was on fire
            So I dropped all my files and raced to my car
            Examined each wire and door left ajar
            I wondered which of my senses had played this cruel joke
            For I was still choking on each tendril of smoke
            
            I thought my house was on fire
            So I left my lover alone in the cold
            I crashed my car on the side of the road
            I sat on the ground, powerless in my shame
            And wondered why my friends’ houses were never aflame
            
            I thought my house was on fire
            I barred all the windows and blocked all the doors
            Threw out the wood and watered the floors
            For if there was one thing I had learned
            It was that I did not want anyone else to burn
            
            My house is on fire
            You saw the signs and heard the alarms
            And ran in and cradled me so gently in your arms
            But the searing hot fire against my skin is your touch
            Because sometimes being loved is just too much
